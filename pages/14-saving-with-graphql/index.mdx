# Exercise 14 – Saving with GraphQL

Modify `pages/14-saving-with-graphql/[bookId].js` to write the form values back to the database.

You will need to click on a book at get to the form.

At any time, if your database gets messed up, you can run `git checkout database.json` to revert to the original values.

<BookList />

## Description

As we have seen, the `onSubmit` function given to `<Form/>` is what is called when our form passes validation and is being submitted. In most use cases, submission is an asynchronous server request, so the `onSubmit` usually returns a `Promise`.

### GraphQL Mutations

Similar to queries, GraphQL mutations are how we transmit data back to the server.

The mutation syntax for our "books" schema looks like this:

```graphql
mutation($id: Int!, $Book: UpdateBookInput!) {
  updateBook(id: $id, Book: $Book) {
    success
    Book {
      title
      author {
        firstName
        lastName
      }
      year
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that it returns a `success` boolean as well as letting us query the newly updated values under the `Book` key.

Open up the [GraphQL Playground](/api/graphql) and paste that mutation in. As you might expect, we're going to need some variables.

Paste the following into the "Query Variables" section of the playground:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "Book": {
    "title": "My New Title",
    "author": {
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Doe"
    },
    "year": 2020
}
```

If you hit ▶️, it will update the book with `id == 2` with our new data. Refresh this page and look at the list at the top to confirm.

Don't forget that at any time, if your database gets messed up, you can run `git checkout database.json` to revert to the original values.

### The `useMutation` hook

The [`useMutation` hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/#usemutation) is very similar to the `useQuery` hook, except that it gives us a function to call to send the data. [Read the official docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/#usemutation) and see if you can figure out how to submit your form data.
