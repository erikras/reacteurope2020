# Exercise 13 – Loading from GraphQL

Modify `pages/13-loading-from-graphql/[bookId].js` to load the values for the book into the form for editing. We won't worry about saving just yet.

You will need to click on a book at get to the form. You may find it useful to play around in the [GraphQL Playground](/api/graphql).

<BookList />

## Description

The way you initialize a form with values in React Final Form is to pass an [`initialValues` prop](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FormProps#initialvalues) to `<Form/>`.

### Intro to GraphQL

GraphQL is one of the nicest ways of communicating between the client and the server because the client gets full control over exactly which bits of data are trasmitted back from the server. Gone are the RESTful days of a huge data object being returned from the server just to render the first and last name of a client.

We're going to learn by playing. A typical GraphQL query will look something like this. You can think of it a little like "JSON without the commas".

```graphql
query {
  books {
    title
  }
}
```

Open up the [GraphQL Playground](/api/graphql) and paste that query into the left side of the playground and hit ▶️.

Now add the `year` and hit ▶️ again. But don't paste it, actually type it in and watch how the playground already knows what the valid values are and autocompletes for you.

```graphql
query {
  books {
    title
    year
  }
}
```

Now add the `author`.

```graphql
query {
  books {
    title
    author
    year
  }
}
```

That didn't work, did it? The author is tricky, because the author is really a "foreign key" to the collection of authors, and the author object has its own structure, so we have to specify precisely _which_ fields of the author we want returned.

Try this:

```graphql
query {
  books {
    title
    author {
      firstName
    }
    year
  }
}
```

### Query Variables

In GraphQL, we can specify variables that will be passed at runtime to our queries. The variables are strongly typed, so be careful!

Try pasting this into the playground:

```graphql
query($id: Int!) {
  book(id: $id) {
    title
    year
  }
}
```

This won't work until you pass a query variable. To do that, open the "Query Variables" drawer at the bottom left of the playground. In there, type in:

```json
{
  "id": 2
}
```

Now you can hit ▶️, and it will fetch the book with `id == 2` from the server. See if you can figure out how to also get the author's first name?

### The `useQuery` hook

For this workshop, we will be using [Apollo Client's `useQuery` hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/#usequery).

The `<BookList/>` component rendering the list above is using the hook like this:

```jsx
const { data } = useQuery(gql`
  query {
    books {
      id
      title
      author {
        firstName
        lastName
      }
      year
    }
  }
`)
const books = data && data.books
```

The GraphQL query in there should look familiar to you. It is placed inside a `gql` "string literal" with backticks.

### Passing variables to `useQuery`

The second parameter of `useQuery()` is an [object of options](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/#options). We will place our variables in the options object under the key `variables`. The following code will fetch the book with `id == 2`.

```jsx
const { data } = useQuery(
  gql`
    query($id: Int!) {
      book(id: $id) {
        title
      }
    }
  `,
  {
    variables: {
      id: 2,
    },
  }
)
const book = data && data.book
```
